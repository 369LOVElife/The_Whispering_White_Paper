# Quick Reference: Resolving PR #14 Conflicts

## TL;DR - What to Do

**Problem**: PR #14 has merge conflicts with main branch in README.md

**Solution**: Accept the PR branch version of README.md (the short, clean one)

## Quick Commands

```bash
# 1. Checkout PR branch
git fetch origin copilot/check-md-file-validity
git checkout copilot/check-md-file-validity

# 2. Merge main (will show conflict)
git merge main

# 3. Accept PR version of README.md
# When you see conflict markers in README.md:
# - Keep the version between <<<<<<< HEAD and =======
# - Discard the version between ======= and >>>>>>>

# 4. Stage and commit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolve conflict: Accept PR #14 changes"

# 5. Push
git push origin copilot/check-md-file-validity
```

## What Each Version Contains

| Version | Content | Lines | Keep? |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| **PR Branch** (HEAD) | Clean repository README | ~25 | ✅ YES |
| **Main Branch** | White paper wrapped in code fences | ~900 | ❌ NO |

## Why Accept PR Changes?

1. ✅ Fixes markdown rendering (removes code fences)
2. ✅ Better repository structure
3. ✅ Separates docs from content
4. ✅ Follows GitHub best practices
