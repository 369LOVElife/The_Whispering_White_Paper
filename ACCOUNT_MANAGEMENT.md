   - Download repositories as ZIP files
   - Export issues and discussions
   - Save important code snippets

2. **Transfer or Delete Repositories**: 
   - Transfer ownership of repositories you own to another account, or

## Removing Your Contributions

### Understanding Contribution Retention

Even if you delete your GitHub account, your contributions to this repository will remain because:

- Git history is immutable by design
- Your commits are identified by email and timestamp
- Pull requests and issues become "ghost" contributions

### Options for Contribution Management

1. **Request Commit Rewriting** (Complex and Discouraged):
   - Contact the repository maintainer
   - Request a git history rewrite to remove your commits
   - Note: This affects everyone who has cloned the repository

2. **Request Credit Removal** (Simple):
   - Ask the maintainer to update documentation
   - Remove your name from contributor lists
   - Update copyright attributions

3. **License Considerations**:
   - Your contributions are licensed under the repository's license (see LICENSE file)
   - License grants are irrevocable in most cases
   - Review the LICENSE file for specific terms

### Deleting Your Fork

2. Click "Settings"
3. Scroll to the bottom
4. Click "Delete this repository"
5. Type the repository name to confirm
6. Click "I understand the consequences, delete this repository"

### Removing Local Clones

To remove local clones from your computer:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why can't I delete my account?

**A**: There are several reasons you might have trouble deleting your GitHub account:

1. **You're the sole owner of an organization**: Transfer ownership first
2. **You have pending payments or billing issues**: Resolve these first
3. **You're using 2FA**: You'll need your 2FA device to authenticate
4. **You haven't verified your identity**: GitHub may require additional verification
5. **You have active subscriptions**: Cancel all subscriptions first

**Solution**: Address any blocking issues, then try again. Contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) if you need help.

### Q: What happens to my contributions after I delete my account?

**A**: Your contributions remain in the repository but become "ghost" contributions. They'll show your commit name and email but won't link to a GitHub profile.

### Q: Can I remove my commits from this repository?

**A**: Technically yes, but practically it's very difficult and disruptive:
- Requires rewriting git history (force push)
- Breaks everyone's local clones
- Not recommended unless absolutely necessary
- Contact the repository maintainer to discuss

### Q: How do I stop receiving notifications from this repository?

**A**: 
1. Click "Unwatch" at the top of the repository page
2. Select "Participating and @mentions" or "Ignore"
3. You can also unsubscribe from specific issues/PRs

### Q: Can I transfer my contributions to another account?

**A**: Not directly, but you can:
- Update your git config with new email before future commits
- Ask maintainers to update contributor lists
- Your old commits will remain under the old email

### Q: What if I accidentally committed sensitive information?

**A**: 
1. **Act quickly!** The sooner the better
2. Contact the repository maintainer immediately
3. Use tools like [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch`
4. Rotate any exposed credentials immediately
5. See [GitHub's guide on removing sensitive data](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)

### Q: How do I change my email address on past commits?

**A**: 
- This requires rewriting git history
- See [GitHub's guide on changing author info](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)
- This is disruptive and should only be done with maintainer approval
