# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

This repository is configured to work with GitHub Pages. Follow these steps to enable it:

## Enabling GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/369LOVElife/The_Whispering_White_Paper
2. Click on **Settings** (gear icon) in the top navigation
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select the branch you want to use (typically `main` or `master`)
5. Keep the folder as `/ (root)`
6. Click **Save**

## What Happens After Enabling

- GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
- Your paper will be available at: **https://369LOVElife.github.io/The_Whispering_White_Paper/**
- It may take a few minutes for the site to become available after the first deployment
- Any updates you push to the repository will automatically update the site

## Files Configured for GitHub Pages

- `index.html` - The main page that displays your white paper
- `.nojekyll` - Ensures GitHub Pages serves your HTML files correctly
- `README.md` - Updated with a shareable link to your GitHub Pages site

## Sharing Your Paper

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, you can share this link anywhere:

**https://369LOVElife.github.io/The_Whispering_White_Paper/**

This link:
- ✅ Works on all social media platforms
- ✅ Is secure (served over HTTPS)
- ✅ Is hosted by GitHub (reliable and free)
- ✅ Updates automatically when you update the repository
- ✅ Displays your paper in a clean, formatted HTML view

## Troubleshooting

If your page doesn't appear after 5-10 minutes:
1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
2. Make sure the branch selected in Settings matches your current branch
3. Check the Actions tab to see if the deployment succeeded
4. Clear your browser cache and try again

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use your own domain name instead of the GitHub Pages URL:
1. In Settings > Pages, enter your custom domain
2. Follow GitHub's instructions to configure your DNS settings
